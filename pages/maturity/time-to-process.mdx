# How long will it take for my instruction to be processed?

It depends on what choice you’ve made.

* If you choose to buy shares and keep them, they’ll usually be in your EquatePlus account within two working days.
* If you choose to buy shares and sell all of them straight away, your money will be sent to you two days after you sell. Remember it can take up to 5 days for the money to reach your bank account (longer for international transactions) and during the festive season this can take longer than usual.
* If you choose to take your savings back as cash, the money will usually be in your bank account in 2-5 working days.
