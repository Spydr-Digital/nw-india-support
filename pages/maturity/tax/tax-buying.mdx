# Buying Shares

If you choose to buy shares when the plan ends, you’ll need to pay income tax on the difference between the price you pay (the option price) and the market price on the day you buy them. NatWest will report the differential values as perquisite income in the following month's payroll, deduct the tax for you and pay it to the government.

We’ll send you a Form 16 and Form 12BA by 15 June the following year to show you’ve paid the tax.
