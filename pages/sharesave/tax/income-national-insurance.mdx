# Income tax and National Insurance

We take your chosen amount from your pay after tax has been paid, so you won’t need to pay any more income tax or National Insurance on your savings.
If you choose to buy NatWest shares at the end of the plan, and you keep them, you’ll be entitled to any dividends we pay to our shareholders. Depending on your situation you might need to pay income tax on these dividends.
