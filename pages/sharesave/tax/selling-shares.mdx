# Selling shares

If you’re selling shares less than 12 months after you bought them, any gain will be taxed under the short-term capital gains rules, so you’ll pay a flat rate of 20%, plus health and education cess and, if applicable, surcharge.

If you’re selling after 12 months, the long-term capital gains rules will apply, so you’ll pay a flat rate of 12.5%, plus health and education cess and, if applicable, surcharge. Indexation will also apply, which could reduce the tax you pay. NatWest is not responsible for taxes related to your sale proceeds.
