# Capital gains tax

If you buy NatWest shares at the end of the plan and sell them at a profit, you might need to pay capital gains tax.

Under the current rules you’re allowed to make £6,000 of gains each tax year before you have to pay any tax, but this is being reduced to £3,000 from the 2023/4 tax year.

Remember you’ll only need to pay tax if you make a profit in excess of the limit.

There are a number of ways to reduce any capital gains tax liability, and in most cases you’ll be able to avoid paying it entirely. You’ll find more information in [our helpful blog post](https://www.natwestshareplans.com/news/sharesave-and-capital-gains).

We’re giving you the tax information above to help you make your own decisions. It’s not advice. It’s based on our understanding of current tax rules, but these might change. Remember that tax depends on your individual situation – if you’re not sure you should seek professional advice.
