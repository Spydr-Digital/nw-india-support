# I’m on long-term leave (e.g. maternity, paternity, adoption, partner) or long-term sick leave?

If you’re being paid via payroll, we’ll still take your payment. If you’re not being paid, you can make direct payments to Computershare instead. Just get in touch with Computershare directly and they’ll help you set up payments from your bank account. You’ll also need to [let payroll know](https://hrforms.web.rbsgrp.net/forms/sharesave_payment_suspension/) you’re doing this.

If you don’t do this, these payments will be missed, but you can make them up later. This will delay when your savings plan finishes, as you’ll need to catch up on the delayed payments. If you need to delay payments at any other time you can do this too.

You can delay up to 12 payments in total. See the FAQ on [‘Can I change or stop my payment?’](/sharesave/managing/change-payment) for more details.
