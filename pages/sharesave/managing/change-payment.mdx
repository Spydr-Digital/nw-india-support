# Can I change or stop my payment?

You can’t change your amount during the plan.

But if you’re in the UK, Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man or Gibraltar, you can delay up to 12 payments if you need to. This will also delay when your savings plan finishes, as you’ll need to catch up on the delayed payments.

If you miss more than 12 payments, you’ll lose your right to buy NatWest shares, but you’ll get all your money back.

If you want to delay payments, you’ll need to [complete this form](https://hrforms.web.rbsgrp.net/forms/sharesave_payment_suspension/).

If you want to stop saving and cancel the plan you can do this and have all your money returned. You can do this via EquatePlus or by calling +44 (0)370 702 0109. If you cancel after that month’s payroll cut-off date, the payment will be taken and returned to you the following month.

If you’ve made 12 or more monthly payments, you’ll still receive some interest.
