# How do I sell shares?

You can sell your shares by logging into your EquatePlus account and following the instructions.
Remember that if you sell partnership shares before you’ve held them for five years, you’ll need to pay tax. This will be automatically taken off your sale amount, which you’ll get through payroll.
If you sell shares where no tax is due, the money will be paid straight to your bank account.
