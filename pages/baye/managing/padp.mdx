# What about the Personal Account Dealing Policy?

If the PAD policy applies to you, you can’t start, stop, or change your monthly investment when you’re in a closed period.

If you’re an insider or work in a defined business area, you’ll need to get prior authorisation if you want to join or make changes outside a prohibited period.

Any share sales are subject to the policy - you can check the rules here.
