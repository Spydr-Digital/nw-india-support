# Can I change or stop my payment?

Yes – you can do this any time (subject to the Personal Account Dealing Policy – see FAQ below).
You’ll need to make any changes by the last day of the month for them to apply the following month.
You can make changes through the EquatePlus website, or by calling +44 (0)370 702 0109.
