# I leave NatWest?

If you leave because you’re made redundant, retire, or through injury or disability, or the company you’re employed by is no longer part of NatWest, your shares will be transferred to a dealing account with Computershare. You won’t need to pay any tax.
If you resign or you’re dismissed, your shares will be transferred to a dealing account, but Computershare will sell a number of shares to cover the tax and National Insurance due.
Computershare will be in touch with you at the time to explain your options.
