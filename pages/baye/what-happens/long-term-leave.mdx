# I’m on long-term leave (e.g. maternity, paternity, adoption, partner) or long-term sick leave?

If you’re being paid via payroll, we’ll still take your payment. If you’re not being paid, you can make direct payments to Computershare instead. Just get in touch with Computershare directly and they’ll help you set up payments from your bank account.
Your monthly contributions can’t be more than £150, or 10% of your gross monthly pay, whichever is lowest. Where these limits would be breached, your contribution will be scaled down.
